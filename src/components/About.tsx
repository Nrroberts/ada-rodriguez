            I am a bilingual and bicultural licensed professional counselor with over 20 years of experience across diverse 
            settings, including a nonprofit mental health clinic, a managed care organization, and a public elementary school. 
            Originally from San Salvador, El Salvador, I relocated to Connecticut to pursue a master&apos;s degree in psychology. 
            My personal journey—marked by experiences of acculturation, parenting challenges, and significant loss—has 
            deepened my resilience and reinforced my commitment to supporting others through life&apos;s complexities.

            My clinical practice focuses on children (ages 6+), adolescents, and adults navigating a range of concerns, 
            including mood disorders, anxiety, ADHD, adjustment issues, acculturation stress, and grief/loss. I employ an 
            eclectic, client-centered approach tailored to each individual&apos;s unique needs.
          </p>

            I offer free consultations to determine whether my services are a good fit. Morning and early afternoon 
            appointments are available Monday through Thursday.
